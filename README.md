### 1. Project Setup

**Description:** Assuming that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/) installed you should only need to clone the repo to your machine and run

    
    npm install
    

That will install all the required dependencies for the framework to function.

### 2. Running Tests Locally

To run the tests locally you only need to execute the following command: 

    
    npm test
    

### 3. Running Tests with TravisCI
This repo has [TravisCI Integrration](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/cmpinzonh/sc-api-challenge) which means that with every push to a remote branch a build will be triggered, that including attempts to merge to a pull request. Manually triggering a build of a specific desired branch is also possible.

### 4. Calliope.pro Report
I created a sandbox company in Calliope.pro and updated the report generated by [mochawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome), said report can be found in: [Calliope.pro report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley).
